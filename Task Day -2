Write a blog difference between document object and window object.
 
Window object : 
 
  1) It represents the browser's window. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. 
  2) Global variables are properties of the window object.
  3) Global functions are methods of the window object.
 
Document object : 

1) Document object is a part of window object
2) The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
